  - *Partially: Only one 12-seat layout exists*
  - *Location: server/seed.ts*
  - *Gap: Missing 8-seat layout and BUS-B vehicle*

- ‚ùå **Pattern AB_via_C** (pickup-only at PWK)
  - *Partially: Pattern exists but not with pickup-only config*
  - *Location: server/seed.ts*
  - *Gap: Pattern stops need proper boarding/alighting flags*

- ‚ùå **Trip Bases** (10:00 Slot-1, 10:00 Slot-2, 13:00 Slot-1)
  - *Missing: No trip bases in seed data*
  - *Location: server/seed.ts*
  - *Gap: Need to add trip bases with proper time slots*

### Summary Status
- ‚úÖ **Core backend infrastructure**: 80% complete
- üîÅ **Frontend integration**: 60% complete  
- ‚ùå **Realtime functionality**: 0% complete
- ‚ùå **Complete seed data**: 30% complete

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Add complete seed data with trip bases and proper pickup-only configuration
2. Implement WebSocket realtime events system
3. Add Virtual/Closed badges to CSO TripSelector
4. Test and fix materialize flow integration
5. Add seatmap realtime locking on trip closure
